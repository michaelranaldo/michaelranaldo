# Michael Ranaldo

I am a security consultant who helps stop companies being not secure.

Have a look through my repositories for tooling I've developed or my previous work.

Check out my site at [https://ranaldo.co.uk](ranaldo.co.uk) for random mostly cyber-security content.

I'm open to collaboration or questions and I might even be helpful.

I can also be found on both [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelranaldo/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaeljranaldo).
